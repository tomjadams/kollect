     * Returns the current time, as a Unix timestamp (number of time units

     *
     * This is the pure equivalent of Java's `System.currentTimeMillis`,
     * or of `CLOCK_REALTIME` from Linux's `clock_gettime()`.
     *
     * The provided `TimeUnit` determines the time unit of the output,
     * its precision, but not necessarily its resolution, which is
     * implementation dependent. For example this will return the number
     * of milliseconds since the epoch:
     *
     * {{{

     *
     *   clock.realTime(MILLISECONDS)

     * N.B. the resolution is limited by the underlying implementation
     * and by the underlying CPU and OS. If the implementation uses
     * `System.currentTimeMillis`, then it can't have a better
     * resolution than 1 millisecond, plus depending on underlying
     * runtime (e.g. Node.js) it might return multiples of 10
     * milliseconds or more.
     *
     * See [[monotonic]], for fetching a monotonic value that
     * may be better suited for doing time measurements.

     * {{{

     *
     * The returned value can have nanoseconds resolution and represents
     * the number of time units elapsed since some fixed but arbitrary
     * origin time. Usually this is the Unix epoch, but that's not
     * a guarantee, as due to the limits of `Long` this will overflow in
     * the future (2^63^ is about 292 years in nanoseconds) and the
     * implementation reserves the right to change the origin.
     *
     * The return value should not be considered related to wall-clock
     * time, the primary use-case being to take time measurements and
     * compute differences between such values, for example in order to
     * measure the time it took to execute a task.
     *
     * As a matter of implementation detail, the default `Clock[IO]`
     * implementation uses `System.nanoTime` and the JVM will use
     * `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` when available, instead of `CLOCK_REALTIME`
     * (see `clock_gettime()` on Linux) and it is up to the underlying
     * platform to implement it correctly.
     *
     * And be warned, there are platforms that don't have a correct
     * implementation of `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`. For example at the moment of
     * writing there is no standard way for such a clock on top of
     * JavaScript and the situation isn't so clear cut for the JVM
     * either, see:
     *
     *  - [[https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6458294 bug report]]
     *  - [[http://cs.oswego.edu/pipermail/concurrency-interest/2012-January/008793.html concurrency-interest]]
     *    discussion on the X86 tsc register
     *
     * The JVM tries to do the right thing and at worst the resolution
     * and behavior will be that of `System.currentTimeMillis`.
     *
     * The recommendation is to use this monotonic clock when doing
     * measurements of execution time, or if you value monotonically
     * increasing values more than a correspondence to wall-time, or
     * otherwise prefer [[realTime]].
