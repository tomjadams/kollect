/**
 * Timer is a scheduler of tasks.
 *
 * This is the purely functional equivalent of:
 *
 *  - Java's
 *    [[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledExecutorService.html ScheduledExecutorService]]
 *  - JavaScript's
 *    [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout setTimeout]].
 *
 * It provides:
 *
 *  1. the ability to get the current time
 *  1. ability to delay the execution of a task with a specified time duration
 *
 * It does all of that in an `F` monadic context that can suspend
 * side effects and is capable of asynchronous execution (e.g. [[IO]]).
 *
 * This is NOT a type class, as it does not have the coherence
 * requirement.

     * boundary, even if the provided `timespan` is less or
     * equal to zero.
